# Two Stage Opamp
---

## Circuit Overview

The circuit consists of three key sections:

### 1. **Biasing Stage**
- **Purpose:** Provides stable reference bias current of `30 ÂµA` for tail current sources in the amplifier.
- **Key Component:** Transistor **M8** and a current source.

### 2. **Stage 1 â€“ Differential Amplifier**
- **Transistors:** M1, M2 (differential pair); M3, M4 (PMOS current mirror load); M5 (tail current source).
- **Function:** Converts differential input signal to a single-ended output. Uses current mirror for gain and biasing.

### 3. **Stage 2 â€“ Gain Stage**
- **Transistors:** M6 (PMOS load), M7 (common-source NMOS amplifier).
- **Capacitors:** Compensation capacitor `Cc = 3 pF`, Load capacitor `CL = 10 pF`.
- **Function:** Provides additional gain and drives capacitive load.
